Slightly buffs the Crusaders skills by adding the Unholy Killer effect (The same effect Smite and Holy Lance have) to Zealous Accusation, as well as allowing Holy Lance to hit Rank 1. 

Also Buffs the Crusaders Crimson Court trinket set by adding +15% Deathblow Resist to the glittering Spaulders and by adding +25% Virtue Chance to the Set Bonus.

I made this mod a very long time ago, since then my opinion of the crusader has improved quite a bit and these days I'd probably consider this mod a bit op :P
